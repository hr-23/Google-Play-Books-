Match Between
the System and the Real World
Implementations
The app's name and every major section clearly indicate that it deals with books, ensuring users
recognize its purpose.
It features a simple page-turning animation that mimics the experience of turning pages in a
physical book.
The app allows users to organize their books on virtual shelves, similar to arranging books on
real-life bookshelves.
The night light option provides a reading hue that is easier on the eyes in the dark, similar to
using a reading lamp at night.
The Shop section categorizes best sellers, new releases, and books on sale, replicating the
organization of a physical bookstore.
Violations
The Series tab is unclear, as it does not specify whether the books belong to an author-specific
series, a character-specific series, or a Google Play curated series, unlike in a bookstore where
series information is clearly displayed.
The absence of page numbers on the book's main page is a significant oversight, as this is a
fundamental element of physical books; displaying the page number only in the progress bar
does not align with traditional book navigation.
