Usability

Heuristics
Usability heuristics are guidelines that help designers assess the user-friendliness of a product's
interface. These principles act as rules of thumb to ensure interfaces are clear, and intuitive, and minimize
user errors. Adhering to these heuristics results in better user experiences for novice and
experienced users.

Implementations
The app displays the completion status of each eBook.
It indicates the download status of eBooks.
eBooks are categorized in the shop and on the home page by genres, top-selling, new
releases, and deals.
The price of books is clearly shown in the wishlist and shop, indicating if they need to be
purchased.
Inside eBooks, the app shows page numbers in progress bar, pages left in the chapter,
and completion percentage.
The currently playing audiobook is highlighted on the main page.
Violations

The "Now Reading" ebook is not clearly indicated like it is shown for audiobooks, causing
users to assume the topmost or leftmost book is the most recent read.
The absence of a progress bar on the library page, with only a percentage displayed, makes
the UI is less intuitive and harder for users to understand their reading progress.
The number of purchased books in a series is shown, but the images do not clearly
indicate which books have been bought, causing users to click each one to identify
purchased titles, creating confusion about their collection.
