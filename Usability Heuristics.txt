Heuristics
Usability heuristics are guidelines that help designers assess the user-friendliness of a product's
interface. These principles act as rules of thumb to ensure interfaces are clear, intuitive, and minimize
user errors. Adhering to these heuristics results in better user experiences for both novice and
experienced users.
