Google Play Books appears to be underperforming in
several areas. In contrast, despite generating
relatively insignificant revenue from Kindle, Amazon remains
the dominant player in the e-book market. Amazon,
which began as an online bookstore, has continued to
invest in its e-book software even as it expanded into
other sectors. This commitment has allowed Amazon to
maintain the largest customer base in the e-book
market.
